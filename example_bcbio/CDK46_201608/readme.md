CDK46_response_201608

raw data:
/groups/sorger/rnaseq/CDK46_response_201608/fastq

results:
https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn10164318

analysis:
1. merge fastq files with merge_fastq.R
2. run bash commands in 201612_de.bash
3. Run differential expression analysis with de_pertubation.R, this would require MCF7 data from results from CDK46_201701
